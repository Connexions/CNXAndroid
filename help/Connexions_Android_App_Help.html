<h4>Downloading Files</h4>
When viewing content (a chapter or book), the PDF or EPUB of the
content can be downloaded to your phone using the application
menu or the ActionBar at the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; When you select to
download from the menu or the ActionBar, a popup will tell you where the file will be stored and
you will be
asked to confirm the download.&nbsp; Files are downloaded to a
Connexions directory either on your phone's memory or an SD Card if
your phone has one.&nbsp; If your device has an SD Card slot, but the
slot is empty, you will not be able to download files until
a card is in the slot. &nbsp;The EPUB or PDF that is downloaded can be
viewed by using a
separate app for the file type.<br>

<h2><a name="view_downloads"></a>Viewing and Deleting Downloaded Files</h2>
<img src="files.png" alt="Downloaded files" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5"><br>
From almost any menu and from the Landing screen, there is an option to "View Downloaded
Files".&nbsp; Selecting this option will display a list of PDF or EPUB
files that have been downloaded from Connexions.&nbsp; Selecting a file
from the list will give the choice to open&nbsp; and view the
file.&nbsp; If viewing is selected, Connexions for Android will try and
open the file in a different application for that file type.&nbsp; An
example is if a PDF file is selected Connexions for Android will try to
open the file using an app for viewing PDFs such as Adobe Acrobat
Reader for Android.&nbsp; EPUB files can be viewed in an ebook reader
such as Aldiko.
<p>Files can be deleted from the SD Card by pressing down on the item
until a menu is displayed. The only menu option is to delete the
selected file. Confirm the delete and the file is removed from the
phone.</p>

<h2><a name="notes"></a>Taking Notes</h2>

will return you to the content and automatically save the note.  You can also touch the Save button on the ActionBar to save and return you to the content.  There are also menu options to revert the note to the last saved state and the delete the note.  
Notes can also be exported to a text file that can be moved off the phone and shared.  Choose Export from the ActionBar or from the menu.  Notes are exported to the Connexions folder on your phone's SDCard or memory if
